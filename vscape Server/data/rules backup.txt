@dre@=Rules=
1. No Botting. Bots will be investigated and 
banned as seen fit. Banning means anything from
temp 10 hour ban to Account Deletion.

2. No Duping. It destabilizes the already delicate
 economy. Duping will result in account deletion, 
 as well as IP and Mac bans.

3. Afking is not a bannable offense, However failure
 to answer Mods may result in further investigation
 or temporary bans.

Obviously not all incidents are the same, and 
investigation into any reported incidents will
lead to varying levels of punishment based on
 the severity of the crime.
